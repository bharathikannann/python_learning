## Python Learning

This is a repository for my Python learning. I will be using this repository to store my Python learning notes, codes and projects. The repository mainly includes machine learning, deep learning and general Python learning. It is a good place for me to review my learning and share my learning with others. I hope it can help you too. Cheers!

***Note:*** *This repository is still under construction and very new. I will keep updating it.*
